# PHP TextMate Grammar

This repository contains the TextMate grammar for PHP. It also contains an additional PXP grammar file with extensions to support the PXP superset of PHP.

This grammar will eventually be used by our first-party VSCode extension and is available for others to use in other editors / projects too.
